# Answer:

## No change for performance.

# Explanation:

## A table could be created for user attempts and scores, but that would take up more space, add schema complexity, and overhead for data transformation and orchestration. The performance of the queries provided would not justify this in my opinion. 

## Likewise, indexing would take up more space and slow down the INSERT/UPDATE processes that are likely more common for a table/process like the one explained. Again, the performance of the queries provided do not justify the trade off, in my opinion.
